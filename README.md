# Random Quote Machine

This project is part of FreeCodeCamps Front End Development Libaries curriculum. 

The objective of this project is to create a machine that generates a random quote. This project challenged us to utilize both CSS and JS libraries in its construction, allowing us to explore the possibilities and advantages of using pre-built code in our own work. I used bootstap for styling. In addition, I used JQuery access elements in the DOM.

## Contributions:
My generator origninally had 5 quotes and would cycle through the 5 quotes. I wanted to add unlimited quotes
and I found an artice on how to make this happen fetching these quotes from API.
